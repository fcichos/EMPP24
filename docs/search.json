    "section": "6.1 Key Components of a Notebook",
    "text": "6.1 Key Components of a Notebook\nThe Jupyter Notebook ecosystem consists of three main components:\n\nNotebook Editor\nKernels\nNotebook Documents\n\nLet’s explore each of these components in detail:\n\n6.1.1 Notebook Editor\nThe Notebook editor is an interactive web-based application for creating and editing notebook documents. It allows users to write and run code interactively, as well as add rich text and multimedia content. When running Jupyter on a server, you’ll typically use either the classic Jupyter Notebook interface or JupyterLab, which is a more advanced and feature-rich version of the notebook editor.\nKey features of the Notebook editor include:\n\nCode Editing: Write and edit code in individual cells.\nCode Execution: Run code cells in any order and display computation results in various formats (HTML, LaTeX, PNG, SVG, PDF).\nInteractive Widgets: Create and use JavaScript widgets that connect user interface controls to kernel-side computations.\nRich Text: Add documentation using Markdown markup language, including LaTeX equations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvance Notebook Editor Info\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Notebook editor in Jupyter offers several advanced features:\n\nCell Metadata: Each cell has associated metadata that can be used to control its behavior. This includes tags for slideshows, hiding code cells, and controlling cell execution.\nMagic Commands: Special commands prefixed with % (line magics) or %% (cell magics) that provide additional functionality, such as timing code execution or displaying plots inline.\nAuto-completion: The editor provides context-aware auto-completion for Python code, helping users write code more efficiently.\nCode Folding: Users can collapse long code blocks for better readability.\nMultiple Cursors: Advanced editing with multiple cursors for simultaneous editing at different locations.\nSplit View: The ability to split the notebook view, allowing users to work on different parts of the notebook simultaneously.\nVariable Inspector: A tool to inspect and manage variables in the kernel’s memory.\nIntegrated Debugger: Some Jupyter environments offer an integrated debugger for step-by-step code execution and inspection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Kernels\nKernels are the computational engines that execute the code contained in a notebook. They are separate processes that run independently of the notebook editor.\nKey responsibilities of kernels include: * Executing user code * Returning computation results to the notebook editor * Handling computations for interactive widgets * Providing features like tab completion and introspection\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Kernel Info\n\n\n\n\n\nJupyter notebooks are language-agnostic. Different kernels can be installed to support various programming languages such as Python, R, Julia, and many others. The default kernel runs Python code, but users can select different kernels for each notebook via the Kernel menu.\nKernels communicate with the notebook editor using a JSON-based protocol over ZeroMQ/WebSockets. For more technical details, see the messaging specification.\nEach kernel runs in its own environment, which can be customized to include specific libraries and dependencies. This allows users to create isolated environments for different projects, ensuring that dependencies do not conflict.\nKernels also support interactive features such as:\n\nTab Completion: Provides suggestions for variable names, functions, and methods as you type, improving coding efficiency.\nIntrospection: Allows users to inspect objects, view documentation, and understand the structure of code elements.\nRich Output: Supports various output formats, including text, images, videos, and interactive widgets, enhancing the interactivity of notebooks.\n\nAdvanced users can create custom kernels to support additional languages or specialized computing environments. This involves writing a kernel specification and implementing the necessary communication protocols.\nFor managing kernels, Jupyter provides several commands and options:\n\nStarting a Kernel: Automatically starts when a notebook is opened.\nInterrupting a Kernel: Stops the execution of the current code cell, useful for halting long-running computations.\nRestarting a Kernel: Clears the kernel’s memory and restarts it, useful for resetting the environment or recovering from errors.\nShutting Down a Kernel: Stops the kernel and frees up system resources.\n\nUsers can also monitor kernel activity and resource usage through the Jupyter interface, ensuring efficient and effective use of computational resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.3 Notebook Documents\nNotebook documents are self-contained files that encapsulate all content created in the notebook editor. They include code inputs/outputs, Markdown text, equations, images, and other media. Each document is associated with a specific kernel and serves as both a human-readable record of analysis and an executable script to reproduce the work.\nCharacteristics of notebook documents:\n\nFile Extension: Notebooks are stored as files with a .ipynb extension.\nStructure: Notebooks consist of a linear sequence of cells, which can be one of three types:\n\nCode cells: Contain executable code and its output.\nMarkdown cells: Contain formatted text, including LaTeX equations.\nRaw cells: Contain unformatted text, preserved when converting notebooks to other formats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Notebook Documents Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Control: Notebook documents can be version controlled using systems like Git. This allows users to track changes, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions if needed. Tools like nbdime provide diff and merge capabilities specifically designed for Jupyter Notebooks.\nCell Tags: Cells in a notebook can be tagged with metadata to control their behavior during execution, export, or presentation. For example, tags can be used to hide input or output, skip execution, or designate cells as slides in a presentation.\nInteractive Widgets: Notebook documents can include interactive widgets that allow users to manipulate parameters and visualize changes in real-time. This is particularly useful for data exploration and interactive simulations.\nExtensions: The Jupyter ecosystem supports a wide range of extensions that enhance the functionality of notebook documents. These extensions can add features like spell checking, code formatting, and integration with external tools and services.\nSecurity: Notebook documents can include code that executes on the user’s machine, which poses security risks. Jupyter provides mechanisms to sanitize notebooks and prevent the execution of untrusted code. Users should be cautious when opening notebooks from unknown sources.\nCollaboration: Jupyter Notebooks can be shared and collaboratively edited in real-time using platforms like Google Colab, Microsoft Azure Notebooks, and JupyterHub. These platforms provide cloud-based environments where multiple users can work on the same notebook simultaneously.\nCustomization: Users can customize the appearance and behavior of notebook documents using CSS and JavaScript. This allows for the creation of tailored interfaces and enhanced user experiences.\nExport Options: In addition to static formats, notebooks can be exported to interactive formats like dashboards and web applications. Tools like Voila convert notebooks into standalone web applications that can be shared and deployed.\nProvenance: Notebooks can include provenance information that tracks the origin and history of data and computations. This is important for reproducibility and transparency in scientific research.\nDocumentation: Notebook documents can serve as comprehensive documentation for projects, combining code, results, and narrative text. This makes them valuable for teaching, tutorials, and sharing research findings.\nPerformance: Large notebooks with many cells and outputs can become slow and unwieldy. Techniques like cell output clearing, using lightweight data formats, and splitting notebooks into smaller parts can help maintain performance.\nIntegration: Jupyter Notebooks can integrate with a wide range of data sources, libraries, and tools. This includes databases, cloud storage, machine learning frameworks, and visualization libraries, making them a versatile tool for data science and research.\nInternal Format: Notebook files are JSON text files with binary data encoded in base64, making them easy to manipulate programmatically.\nExportability: Notebooks can be exported to various static formats (HTML, reStructuredText, LaTeX, PDF, slide shows) using Jupyter’s nbconvert utility.\nSharing: Notebooks can be shared via nbviewer, which renders notebooks from public URLs or GitHub as static web pages, allowing others to view the content without installing Jupyter.\n\n\n\n\nThis integrated system of editor, kernels, and documents makes Jupyter Notebooks a powerful tool for interactive computing, data analysis, and sharing of computational narratives.",

    "text": "6.2 Using the Notebook Editor\n\n\n\nJupyter Notebook Editor\n\n\nThe Jupyter Notebook editor provides an interactive environment for writing code, creating visualizations, and documenting computational workflows. It consists of a web-based interface that allows users to create and edit notebook documents containing code, text, equations, images, and interactive elements. A Jupyter Notebook provides an interface with essentially two modes of operation:\n\nedit mode the mode where you edit a cells content.\ncommand mode the mode where you execute the cells content.\n\nIn the more advanced version of JupyterLab you can also have a presentation mode where you can present your notebook as a slideshow.\n\n6.2.1 Edit mode\nEdit mode is indicated by a blue cell border and a prompt showing in the editor area when a cell is selected. You can enter edit mode by pressing Enter or using the mouse to click on a cell’s editor area.\n\n\n\nEdit Mode\n\n\nWhen a cell is in edit mode, you can type into the cell, like a normal text editor\n\n\n6.2.2 Command mode\nCommand mode is indicated by a grey cell border with a blue left margin. When you are in command mode, you are able to edit the notebook as a whole, but not type into individual cells. Most importantly, in command mode, the keyboard is mapped to a set of shortcuts that let you perform notebook and cell actions efficiently.\n\n\n\nCommand Mode\n\n\nIf you have a hardware keyboard connected to your iOS device, you can use Jupyter keyboard shortcuts. The modal user interface of the Jupyter Notebook has been optimized for efficient keyboard usage. This is made possible by having two different sets of keyboard shortcuts: one set that is active in edit mode and another in command mode.\n\n\n6.2.3 Keyboard navigation\nIn edit mode, most of the keyboard is dedicated to typing into the cell’s editor area. Thus, in edit mode there are relatively few shortcuts available. In command mode, the entire keyboard is available for shortcuts, so there are many more. Most important ones are:\n\nSwitch command and edit mods: Enter for edit mode, and Esc or Control for command mode.\nBasic navigation: ↑/k, ↓/j\nRun or render currently selected cell: Shift+Enter or Control+Enter\nSaving the notebook: s\nChange Cell types: y to make it a code cell, m for markdown and r for raw\nInserting new cells: a to insert above, b to insert below\nManipulating cells using pasteboard: x for cut, c for copy, v for paste, d for delete and z for undo delete\nKernel operations: i to interrupt and 0 to restart\n\n\n\n6.2.4 Running code in your notebook\nCode cells allow you to enter and run code. Run a code cell by pressing the ▶︎ button in the bottom-right panel, or Control+Enter on your hardware keyboard.\n\nv = 23752636\nprint(v)\n\n23752636\n\n\nThere are a couple of keyboard shortcuts for running code:\n\nControl+Enter run the current cell and enters command mode.\nShift+Enter runs the current cell and moves selection to the one below.\nOption+Enter runs the current cell and inserts a new one below.",

    "text": "6.3 Managing the kernel\nCode is run in a separate process called the kernel, which can be interrupted or restarted. You can see kernel indicator in the top-right corner reporting current kernel state: ⚪︎ means kernel is ready to execute code, and ⚫︎ means kernel is currently busy. Tapping kernel indicator will open kernel menu, where you can reconnect, interrupt or restart kernel.\nTry running the following cell — kernel indicator will switch from ⚪︎ to ⚫︎, i.e. reporting kernel as “busy”. This means that you won’t be able to run any new cells until current execution finishes, or until kernel is interrupted. You can then go to kernel menu by tapping the kernel indicator and select “Interrupt”.\nEntering code is pretty easy. You just have to click into a cell and type the commands you want to type. If you have multiple lines of code, just press enter at the end of the line and start a new one.\n\ncode blocks Python identifies blocks of codes belonging together by its identation. This will become important if you write longer code in a cell later. To indent the block, you may use either whitespaces or tabs.\ncomments Comments can be added to annotate the code, such that you or someone else can understand the code.\n\nComments in a single line are started with the # character at in front of the comment.\nComments over multiple lines can be started with '''and end with the same '''.

    "text": "6.4 Markdown in Notebooks\nText can be added to Jupyter Notebooks using Markdown cells. This is extremely useful providing a complete documentation of your calculations or simulations. In this way, everything really becomes an notebook. You can change the cell type to Markdown by using the “Cell Actions” menu, or with a hardware keyboard shortcut m. Markdown is a popular markup language that is a superset of HTML. Its specification can be found here:\nhttps://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\nMarkdown cells can either be rendered or unrendered.\nWhen they are rendered, you will see a nice formatted representation of the cell’s contents.\nWhen they are unrendered, you will see the raw text source of the cell. To render the selected cell, click the ▶︎ button or shift+ enter. To unrender, select the markdown cell, and press enter or just double click.\n\n6.4.1 Markdown basics\nBelow are some basic markdown examples, in its rendered form. If you which to access how to create specific appearances, double click the individual cells to put the into an unrendered edit mode.\nYou can make text italic or bold.

    "section": "6.5 Variables in Python",
    "text": "6.5 Variables in Python\n\n6.5.1 Symbol Names\nVariable names in Python can include alphanumerical characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and the special character _. Normal variable names must start with a letter or an underscore. By convention, variable names typically start with a lower-case letter, while Class names start with a capital letter and internal variables start with an underscore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReserved Keywords\n\n\n\nThere are a number of Python keywords that cannot be used as variable names because Python uses them for other things. These keywords are:\nand, as, assert, break, class, continue, def, del, elif, else, except, exec, finally, for, from, global, if, import, in, is, lambda, not, or, pass, print, raise, return, try, while, with, yield\nBe aware of the keyword lambda, which could easily be a natural variable name in a scientific program. However, as a reserved keyword, it cannot be used as a variable name.\n\n\n\n\n6.5.2 Variable Assignment\nThe assignment operator in Python is =. Python is a dynamically typed language, so we do not need to specify the type of a variable when we create one.\nAssigning a value to a new variable creates the variable:\n\n# variable assignments\nx = 1.0\nmy_favorite_variable = 12.2\nx\n\n1.0\n\n\nAlthough not explicitly specified, a variable does have a type associated with it (e.g., integer, float, string). The type is derived from the value that was assigned to it. To determine the type of a variable, we can use the type function.\n\ntype(x)\n\nfloat\n\n\nIf we assign a new value to a variable, its type can change.\n\nx = 1\n\n\ntype(x)\n\nint\n\n\nIf we try to use a variable that has not yet been defined, we get a NameError error.\n\n#print(g)",

    "text": "6.1 Introduction to Functions\nFunctions are reusable blocks of code that can be executed multiple times from different parts of your program. They help in organizing code, making it more readable, and reducing redundancy. Functions can take input arguments and return output values.\n\n6.1.1 Defining a Function\nA function in Python is defined using the def keyword followed by the name of the function, which is usually descriptive and indicates what the function does. The parameters inside the parentheses indicate what data the function expects to receive. The -&gt; symbol is used to specify the return type of the function.\nHere’s an example:\n\n# Define a function that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum\ndef add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -&gt; int:\n  return a + b\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Calling a Function\nFunctions can be called by specifying the name of the function followed by parentheses containing the arguments. The arguments passed to the function should match the number and type of parameters defined in the function. Here’s an example:\n\n# Call the function with two numbers as input\nresult = add_numbers(2, 3)\nprint(result)  # prints 5\n\n5",

    "section": "6.4 Modules",
    "text": "6.4 Modules\nMost of the functionality in Python is provided by modules. The Python Standard Library is a large collection of modules that provides cross-platform implementations of common facilities such as access to the operating system, file I/O, string management, network communication, math, web-scraping, text manipulation, machine learning and much more.\nTo use a module in a Python module it first has to be imported. A module can be imported using the import statement. For example, to import the module math, which contains many standard mathematical functions, we can do:\n\nimport math\nimport numpy\n\nx = math.sqrt(2 * math.pi)\nx = numpy.sqrt(2 * numpy.pi)\n\nprint(x)\n\n2.5066282746310002\n\n\nThis includes the whole module and makes it available for use later in the program. Alternatively, we can chose to import all symbols (functions and variables) in a module so that we don’t need to use the prefix “math.” every time we use something from the math module:\n\nfrom math import *\n\nx = cos(2 * pi)\n\nprint(x)\n\n1.0\n\n\nThis pattern can be very convenient, but in large programs that include many modules it is often a good idea to keep the symbols from each module in their own namespaces, by using the import math pattern. This would eliminate potentially confusing problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate Your Own Modules\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating your own modules in Python is a great way to organize your code and make it reusable. A module is simply a file containing Python definitions and statements. Here’s how you can create and use your own module:\n\n6.4.0.1 Creating a Module\nTo create a module, you just need to save your Python code in a file with a .py extension. For example, let’s create a module named mymodule.py with the following content:\n# mymodule.py\n\ndef greet(name: str) -&gt; str:\n    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n\ndef add(a: int, b: int) -&gt; int:\n    return a + b\n\n\n6.4.0.2 Using Your Module\nOnce you have created your module, you can import it into other Python scripts using the import statement. Here’s an example of how to use the mymodule we just created:\n# main.py\n\nimport mymodule\n\n# Use the functions from mymodule\nprint(mymodule.greet(\"Alice\"))\nprint(mymodule.add(5, 3))\n\n\n6.4.1 Importing Specific Functions\nYou can also import specific functions from a module using the from ... import ... syntax:\n# main.py\n\nfrom mymodule import greet, add\n\n# Use the imported functions directly\nprint(greet(\"Bob\"))\nprint(add(10, 7))\n\n\n6.4.2 Module Search Path\nWhen you import a module, Python searches for the module in the following locations: 1. The directory containing the input script (or the current directory if no script is specified). 2. The directories listed in the PYTHONPATH environment variable. 3. The default directory where Python is installed.\nYou can view the module search path by printing the sys.path variable:\nimport sys\nprint(sys.path)\n\n\n6.4.3 Creating Packages\nA package is a way of organizing related modules into a directory hierarchy. A package is simply a directory that contains a special file named __init__.py, which can be empty. Here’s an example of how to create a package:\nmypackage/\n    __init__.py\n    module1.py\n    module2.py\nYou can then import modules from the package using the dot notation:\n# main.py\n\nfrom mypackage import module1, module2\n\n# Use the functions from the modules\nprint(module1.some_function())\nprint(module2.another_function())\nCreating and using modules and packages in Python helps you organize your code better and makes it easier to maintain and reuse.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.4.4 Namespaces\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNamespaces\n\n\n\nA namespace is an identifier used to organize objects, e.g. the methods and variables of a module. The prefix math. we have used in the previous section is such a namespace. You may also create your own namespace for a module. This is done by using the import math as mymath pattern.\n\n\n\nimport math as m\n\nx = m.sqrt(2)\n\nprint(x)\n\n1.4142135623730951\n\n\nYou may also only import specific functions of a module.\n\nfrom math import sinh as mysinh\n\n\n\n6.4.5 Contents of a module\nOnce a module is imported, we can list the symbols it provides using the dir function:\n\nimport math\n\nprint(dir(math))\n\n['__doc__', '__file__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__', '__spec__', 'acos', 'acosh', 'asin', 'asinh', 'atan', 'atan2', 'atanh', 'cbrt', 'ceil', 'comb', 'copysign', 'cos', 'cosh', 'degrees', 'dist', 'e', 'erf', 'erfc', 'exp', 'exp2', 'expm1', 'fabs', 'factorial', 'floor', 'fmod', 'frexp', 'fsum', 'gamma', 'gcd', 'hypot', 'inf', 'isclose', 'isfinite', 'isinf', 'isnan', 'isqrt', 'lcm', 'ldexp', 'lgamma', 'log', 'log10', 'log1p', 'log2', 'modf', 'nan', 'nextafter', 'perm', 'pi', 'pow', 'prod', 'radians', 'remainder', 'sin', 'sinh', 'sqrt', 'sumprod', 'tan', 'tanh', 'tau', 'trunc', 'ulp']\n\n\nAnd using the function help we can get a description of each function (almost .. not all functions have docstrings, as they are technically called, but the vast majority of functions are documented this way).\n\nhelp(math.log)\n\nHelp on built-in function log in module math:\n\nlog(...)\n    log(x, [base=math.e])\n    Return the logarithm of x to the given base.\n\n    If the base is not specified, returns the natural logarithm (base e) of x.\n\n\n\n\nmath.log(10)\n\n2.302585092994046\n\n\n\nmath.log(8, 2)\n\n3.0\n\n\nWe can also use the help function directly on modules: Try\nhelp(math)\nSome very useful modules form the Python standard library are os, sys, math, shutil, re, subprocess, multiprocessing, threading.\nA complete lists of standard modules for Python 3 is available at http://docs.python.org/3/library/ .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNamespaces in Your Modules\n\n\n\n\n\n6.4.6 Namespaces in Packages\nYou can also create sub-packages by adding more directories with __init__.py files. This allows you to create a hierarchical structure for your modules:\nmypackage/\n    __init__.py\n    subpackage/\n        __init__.py\n        submodule.py\nYou can then import submodules using the full package name:\n# main.py\n\nfrom mypackage.subpackage import submodule\n\n# Use the functions from the submodule\nprint(submodule.some_sub_function())\n\n\n\nPython Application",

    "section": "7.1 Creating Numpy Arrays",
    "text": "7.1 Creating Numpy Arrays\nThere are a number of ways to initialize new numpy arrays, for example from\n\na Python list or tuples using np.array\nusing functions that are dedicated to generating numpy arrays, such as arange, linspace, etc.\nreading data from files which will be covered in the files section of this course.\n\n\n7.1.1 From lists\nFor example, to create new vector and matrix arrays from Python lists we can use the numpy.array function. This is demonstrated in the following cells:\n\n  #this is a list\n  a = [0, 0, 1, 4, 7, 16, 31, 64, 127]\n\n  type(a)\n\nlist\n\n\n\n  b=np.array(a,dtype=float)\n  type(b)\n\nnumpy.ndarray\n\n\n\n\n7.1.2 Using array-generating functions\nFor larger arrays it is inpractical to initialize the data manually, using explicit python lists. Instead we can use one of the many functions in numpy that generate arrays of different forms and shapes. Some of the more common are:\n\n  #| slideshow: {slide_type: fragment}\n  # create a range\n\n  x = np.arange(0, 10, 1) # arguments: start, stop, step\n  x\n\narray([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])\n\n\n\n  #| slideshow: {slide_type: fragment}\n  x = np.arange(-5, -2, 0.1)\n  x\n\narray([-5. , -4.9, -4.8, -4.7, -4.6, -4.5, -4.4, -4.3, -4.2, -4.1, -4. ,\n       -3.9, -3.8, -3.7, -3.6, -3.5, -3.4, -3.3, -3.2, -3.1, -3. , -2.9,\n       -2.8, -2.7, -2.6, -2.5, -2.4, -2.3, -2.2, -2.1])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlinspace\n\n\n\nThe linspace function creates an array of N evenly spaced points between a starting point and an ending point. The form of the function is linspace(start, stop, N).If the third argument N is omitted,then N=50. The function linspace always includes the end points.\n\n\n\n  #| slideshow: {slide_type: fragment}\n  # using linspace, both end points ARE included\n  np.linspace(0,10,25)\n\narray([ 0.        ,  0.41666667,  0.83333333,  1.25      ,  1.66666667,\n        2.08333333,  2.5       ,  2.91666667,  3.33333333,  3.75      ,\n        4.16666667,  4.58333333,  5.        ,  5.41666667,  5.83333333,\n        6.25      ,  6.66666667,  7.08333333,  7.5       ,  7.91666667,\n        8.33333333,  8.75      ,  9.16666667,  9.58333333, 10.        ])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlogspace\n\n\n\nlogspace is doing equivelent things with logaritmic spacing. The function logspace generates an array of N points between decades 10^start and 10^stop. The form of the function is logspace(start, stop, N). If the third argument N is omitted, then N=50. The function logspace always includes the end points.\n\n\n\n  #| slideshow: {slide_type: fragment}\n  np.logspace(0, 10, 10, base=np.e)\n\narray([1.00000000e+00, 3.03773178e+00, 9.22781435e+00, 2.80316249e+01,\n       8.51525577e+01, 2.58670631e+02, 7.85771994e+02, 2.38696456e+03,\n       7.25095809e+03, 2.20264658e+04])\n\n\nOther types of array creation techniques are listed below. Try around with these commands to get a feeling what they do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmgrid\n\n\n\nmgrid generates a multi-dimensional matrix with increasing value entries, for example in columns and rows.

    "text": "7.2 Manipulating NumPy arrays\n\n7.2.1 Slicing\nSlicing is the name for extracting part of an array by the syntax M[lower:upper:step]. When any of these are unspecified, they default to the values lower=0, upper=size of dimension, step=1. We can also use negative indices to count from the end of the array. Here are some examples:\n\nA = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])\nA\n\narray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n\n\n\nA[1:4]\n\narray([2, 3, 4])\n\n\nAny of the three parameters in M[lower:upper:step] can be ommited.\n\nA[::] # lower, upper, step all take the default values\n\narray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n\n\n\nA[::2] # step is 2, lower and upper defaults to the beginning and end of the array\n\narray([1, 3, 5])\n\n\nNegative indices counts from the end of the array (positive index from the begining) and can be used in any of the three slicing parameters. Here are some examples:\n\nA = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])\n\n\nA[-1] # the last element in the array\n\nnp.int64(5)\n\n\n\nA[2:] # the last three elements\n\narray([3, 4, 5])\n\n\nIndex slicing works exactly the same way for multidimensional arrays. We can slice along each axis independently. Here are some examples:\n\nA = np.array([[n+m*10 for n in range(5)] for m in range(5)])\nA\n\narray([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4],\n       [10, 11, 12, 13, 14],\n       [20, 21, 22, 23, 24],\n       [30, 31, 32, 33, 34],\n       [40, 41, 42, 43, 44]])\n\n\n\n# a block from the original array\nA[1:3, 1:4]\n\narray([[11, 12, 13],\n       [21, 22, 23]])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferences\n\n\n\nSlicing can be effectively used to calculate differences for example for the calculation of derivatives. Here the position \\(y_i\\) of an object has been measured at times \\(t_i\\) and stored in an array each. We wish to calculate the average velocity at the times \\(t_{i}\\) from the arrays by the formula\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  v_{i}=\\frac{y_i-y_{i-1}}{t_{i}-t_{i-1}}\n  \\end{equation}\\]\n\n\n\ny = np.array([ 0. , 1.3, 5. , 10.9, 18.9, 28.7, 40. ])\nt = np.array([ 0. , 0.49, 1. , 1.5 , 2.08, 2.55, 3.2 ])\n\n\nv = (y[1:]-y[:-1])/(t[1:]-t[:-1])\nv\n\narray([ 2.65306122,  7.25490196, 11.8       , 13.79310345, 20.85106383,\n       17.38461538])\n\n\n\n\n7.2.2 Reshaping\nArrays can be reshaped into any form, which contains the same number of elements. For example, a 4-element array can be reshaped into a 2x2 array, or a 2x2 array can be reshaped into a 4-element array. Here are some examples:\n\na=np.zeros(4)\na\n\narray([0., 0., 0., 0.])\n\n\n\nnp.reshape(a,(2,2))\n\narray([[0., 0.],\n       [0., 0.]])\n\n\n\n\n7.2.3 Adding a new dimension: newaxis\nWith newaxis, we can insert new dimensions in an array, for example converting a vector to a column or row matrix. Here are some examples:\n\n  #| slideshow: {slide_type: fragment}\n  v = np.array([1,2,3])\n  v\n\narray([1, 2, 3])\n\n\n\n  #| slideshow: {slide_type: fragment}\n  v.shape\n\n(3,)\n\n\n\n  #| slideshow: {slide_type: fragment}\n  # make a column matrix of the vector v\n  v[:, np.newaxis]\n\narray([[1],\n       [2],\n       [3]])\n\n\n\n  #| slideshow: {slide_type: fragment}\n  # column matrix\n  v[:,np.newaxis].shape\n\n(3, 1)\n\n\n\n  #| slideshow: {slide_type: fragment}\n  # row matrix\n  v[np.newaxis,:].shape\n\n(1, 3)\n\n\n\n\n7.2.4 Stacking and repeating arrays\nUsing function repeat, tile, vstack, hstack, and concatenate we can create larger vectors and matrices from smaller ones by repeating or stacking. Please try the individual functions yourself in your notebook. We wont discuss them in detail here.\n\n7.2.4.1 Tile and repeat\n\n  #| slideshow: {slide_type: skip}\n  a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n  a\n\narray([[1, 2],\n       [3, 4]])\n\n\n\n  #| slideshow: {slide_type: skip}\n  # repeat each element 3 times\n  np.repeat(a, 3)\n\narray([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4])\n\n\n\n  #| slideshow: {slide_type: skip}\n  # tile the matrix 3 times\n  np.tile(a, 3)\n\narray([[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2],\n       [3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4]])\n\n\n\n\n7.2.4.2 Concatenate\nConcatenate joins arrays along an existing axis. Here are some examples:\n\n  #| slideshow: {slide_type: skip}\n  a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n  a\n\narray([[1, 2],\n       [3, 4]])\n\n\n\n  #| slideshow: {slide_type: skip}\n  b = np.array([[5, 6]])\n\n\n  #| slideshow: {slide_type: skip}\n  np.concatenate((a, b), axis=0)\n\narray([[1, 2],\n       [3, 4],\n       [5, 6]])\n\n\n\n  #| slideshow: {slide_type: skip}\n  np.concatenate((a, b.T), axis=1)\n\narray([[1, 2, 5],\n       [3, 4, 6]])\n\n\n\n\n7.2.4.3 Hstack and vstack\nhstack and vstack stack arrays horizontally and vertically. Here are some examples:\n\n  #| slideshow: {slide_type: skip}\n  a = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n  b = np.array([2, 3, 4])\n\n\n  #| slideshow: {slide_type: skip}\n  np.vstack((a,b))\n\narray([[1, 2, 3],\n       [2, 3, 4]])\n\n\n\n  #| slideshow: {slide_type: skip}\n  np.hstack((a,b.T))\n\narray([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4])",

Typically these operation act element wise as seen from the examples below where a is an array of numbers from 0 to 9.\n\n7.3.1 Operation involving one array\n\n  #| slideshow: {slide_type: fragment}\n  a=np.arange(0, 10, 1.5)\n  a\n\narray([0. , 1.5, 3. , 4.5, 6. , 7.5, 9. ])\n\n\n\n  #| slideshow: {slide_type: fragment}\n  a/2\n\narray([0.  , 0.75, 1.5 , 2.25, 3.  , 3.75, 4.5 ])\n\n\n\n  #| slideshow: {slide_type: fragment}\n  a**2\n\narray([ 0.  ,  2.25,  9.  , 20.25, 36.  , 56.25, 81.  ])\n\n\n\n  #| slideshow: {slide_type: fragment}\n  np.sin(a)\n\narray([ 0.        ,  0.99749499,  0.14112001, -0.97753012, -0.2794155 ,\n        0.93799998,  0.41211849])\n\n\n\n  #| slideshow: {slide_type: fragment}\n  np.exp(-a)\n\narray([1.00000000e+00, 2.23130160e-01, 4.97870684e-02, 1.11089965e-02,\n       2.47875218e-03, 5.53084370e-04, 1.23409804e-04])\n\n\n\n  #| slideshow: {slide_type: fragment}\n  (a+2)/3\n\narray([0.66666667, 1.16666667, 1.66666667, 2.16666667, 2.66666667,\n       3.16666667, 3.66666667])\n\n\n\n\n7.3.2 Operations involving multiple arrays\nOperation between multiple vectors allow in particular very quick operations. The operations address then elements of the same index. These operations are called vector operations since the concern the whole array at the same time. The product between two vectors results therefore not in a dot product, which gives one number but in an array of multiplied elements.\n\n  #| ExecuteTime: {end_time: '2017-04-20T21:16:34.978152+02:00', start_time: '2017-04-20T21:16:34.973278'}\n  #| slideshow: {slide_type: fragment}\n  a = np.array([34., -12, 5.,1.2])\n  b = np.array([68., 5.0, 20.,40.])\n\n\n  #| ExecuteTime: {end_time: '2017-04-20T21:16:41.810170+02:00', start_time: '2017-04-20T21:16:41.804038'}\n  #| slideshow: {slide_type: fragment}\n  a + b\n\narray([102. ,  -7. ,  25. ,  41.2])\n\n\n\n  #| ExecuteTime: {end_time: '2017-04-20T21:16:48.002366+02:00', start_time: '2017-04-20T21:16:47.996136'}\n  #| slideshow: {slide_type: fragment}\n  #| tags: []\n  2*b\n\narray([136.,  10.,  40.,  80.])\n\n\nxxw\n\n  #| ExecuteTime: {end_time: '2017-04-20T21:20:19.373091+02:00', start_time: '2017-04-20T21:20:19.367493'}\n  #| slideshow: {slide_type: fragment}\n  a*np.exp(-b)\n\narray([ 9.98743918e-29, -8.08553640e-02,  1.03057681e-08,  5.09802511e-18])\n\n\n\n  #| tags: []\n  v1=np.array([1,2,3])\n  v2=np.array([4,2,3])",
