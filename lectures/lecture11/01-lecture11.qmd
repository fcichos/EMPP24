# Lecture 11

## Oscillations and Waves

### Python Concepts
  - Solving coupled differential equations for oscillatory systems (e.g., damped harmonic oscillators).
  - Using Fourier analysis to study waveforms.

### Application
  - Simulating simple harmonic motion and damped oscillations.
  - Visualizing the motion and analyzing the frequency components of the oscillation.
  - Homework: Extend the simulation to include coupled oscillators or waves on a string.
