# Lecture 5
## Angular Momentum and Rotational Motion

### Python Concepts
  - Introduction to classes in Python (optional, for organizing code).
  - Rotational kinematics and dynamics (moment of inertia, angular momentum).

### Application
  - Simulating the motion of a rotating object (e.g., a spinning disk) and calculating its angular momentum.
  - Visualizing the effect of torque on the objectâ€™s rotation.
  - Homework: Extend the simulation to include the effect of external forces, such as friction.
