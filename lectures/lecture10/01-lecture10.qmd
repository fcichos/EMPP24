# Lecture 10
## Fluid Dynamics and Surface Tension

### Python Concepts
  - Introduction to flow simulation and basic fluid mechanics principles (continuity equation, Bernoulliâ€™s equation).
  - Using `matplotlib` for more advanced visualizations (e.g., vector fields).

### Application
  - Simulating fluid flow in simple scenarios (e.g., flow through a pipe, around an object).
  - Visualizing pressure and velocity fields.
  - Homework: Simulate and visualize a more complex fluid system, such as flow over a wing.
