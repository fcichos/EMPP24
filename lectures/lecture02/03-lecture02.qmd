## Plotting
  - Writing a Python function to calculate and plot the position vs. time for an object moving with constant velocity or constant acceleration.
  - Visualization: Use `matplotlib` to plot simple kinematic graphs (position vs. time, velocity vs. time).
  - Homework: Extend the kinematic function to handle different initial conditions and plot the results.


```{pyodide}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


# Set up the figure, the axis, and the plot element we want to animate
x=np.linspace(0,s*np.pi,100)
y=np.sin(x)

plt.figure(figsize=(4,3))
plt.plot(x,y)
plt.show()

```
