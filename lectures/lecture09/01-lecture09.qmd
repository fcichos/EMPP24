# Lecture 9
## Deformation of Solids

### Python Concepts
  - Basic file handling for reading and writing data (e.g., stress-strain data).
  - Curve fitting using `numpy` or `scipy` to analyze experimental data.

### Application
  - Simulating the deformation of a solid under load (e.g., Hookeâ€™s law for springs).
  - Plotting stress-strain curves and fitting them to experimental data.
  - Homework: Extend the simulation to include plastic deformation or fracture.
