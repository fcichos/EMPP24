# Lecture 8

## Rigid Bodies and Torque

### Python Concepts
  - Introduction to 2D arrays and matrix operations in `numpy`.
  - Using matrix methods to solve systems of equations related to rigid body dynamics.

### Application
  - Simulating the motion of a rigid body under the influence of forces and torques.
  - Visualizing the rotation and translation of the body.
  - Homework: Simulate a rigid body with varying moments of inertia (e.g., a non-uniform object).
