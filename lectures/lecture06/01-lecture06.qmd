# Lecture 6

## Collisions and Conservation Laws

### Python Concepts
  - Advanced conditionals and loops for simulating complex scenarios.
  - Introduction to basic data structures (dictionaries) for handling multiple objects.

### Application
  - Simulating elastic and inelastic collisions in one and two dimensions.
  - Applying conservation laws (momentum and energy) to check the validity of the simulation.
  - Visualization: Plotting the trajectories and velocities of colliding objects.
  - Homework: Simulate a multi-object collision scenario.
