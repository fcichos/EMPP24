# Lecture 7

## Gravitation and Orbital Mechanics

### Python Concepts
  - Solving differential equations using Python (Eulerâ€™s method for numerical integration).
  - Using `scipy` for more advanced numerical methods.

### Application
  - Simulating gravitational forces and orbital motion (e.g., a planet orbiting a star).
  - Visualizing the orbit and calculating parameters like orbital period and eccentricity.
  - Homework: Modify the simulation to include multiple bodies (e.g., a three-body problem).
